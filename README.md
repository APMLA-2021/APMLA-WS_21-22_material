## Course information

**Lecturer**:  [Caterina De Bacco](https://www.cdebacco.com/)

For any general question about the course, use GitHub issues. Before posting, please make sure your question has not been previously answered. Only in case of private question, send us an email. 

**Plan**:  Thu 21st Oct  2021 - Fry 11th Feb 2022, 14 weeks, 2+2 hr/week, 14 weeks, 56hr

**NEWS (16.12.21)**: Assignment has been uploaded and is ready to be tackled! 
Please use the pseudo-code that you find inside the Assignment folder as a template to write the solutions, rename it as surname_name_A_2022.ipynb (if you are submitting by yourself, otherwise surname1_name1_surname2_name2_A_2022.ipynb if you are submitting in a 2-people group. Similarly, please upload a unique .zip file containing the notebook and in case additional material (e.g. figures), again using the format surname_name_A_2022.zip (and similar for groups of 2 people).
The assignement should be submitted at this submission [form](https://forms.gle/dTc5SsWBcXSpB97Q6). Teams can be made of 1 or 2 people. 

**Submission deadline**: Friday 21.01.22 (24.00pm).

NEWS (10.11.21): 
1. Exam dates are **confirmed**: 
- Thursday, 10.02.22, 14.00-16.00, room N2 (Klausur). 
- Monday, 11.04.22, 13.45-15.45, room D4A19 (Nachklausur). 

These are waiting for confirmation of room availability.  

2. The **time** of the Thursday lecture has been anticipated by 15mins, so that we start at 14.00 (instead of 14.15). The class will thus finish at 15.45 (instead of 16.00). 

NEWS (12.10.21): the tutorials (Fridays) have been shifted to the 16.15-17.45 time slot (still on Fridays and in person at A301).

NEWS (4.10.21): the theory part of the class (Thursdays) will take place online on zoom. The tutorials (Fridays) instead will take place in presence (see below).

**Lectures**:  Thursdays **14:00-15.45 pm**  **online** [here](https://zoom.us/j/94529176606?pwd=cjNVTitKOGV5V0o3UUJabDhGSDZJZz09), password: 211021. 

**Tutorials**: Fridays 16.00-18.00pm **in presence** at **A301** (Sand). (To be coordinated with the TA for the starting time at 16.00 or 16.15).

**Feedback**: after every lecture you are free to give a feedback [here](https://forms.gle/1mnCPAxVG1pqkMks6).

**Lecture-free days**: Friday, from Dec 24th 2021 bis Sat Jan 8th 2022 (Weihnachtspause). The lecture on Thursday Dec 23rd will **NOT** take place.   

**Prerequisites**: all the previous knowledge required by the class Probabilistic Machine Learning applies here too. Nothing extra is needed, so if you are following that class, you are good to go here too.
There will be some overlapping contents for sure between the two classes, although my class is more focused on the application side.

For the EXAM, NEED to officially register  either via Campus / ALMA or written if the student cannot register online (closer to the exam date).  

**Grading** : Maximum between 70\% written exam+30\% assignments and 100\% exam.   

* Every assignment is composed by several exercises, which will be released sequentially. Information about assignment submission will be provided later in time but it will be made electronically. 

* Assignment may be done and submitted in groups of up to 3 people (optional).
